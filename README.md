The plug-in now has two drop-down menus: one to select the writing system (Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Nâ€™Ko and Tifinagh at the moment) and one to select the language (we added Farsi, Bulgarian, Russian, Bambara, Romanian, Maninka, Tifinagh). 

## Wordlist builders
If you want to build a dictionary yourself and have a source PDF file you can use these set of scripts to extract words by Unicode Range, by Specific characters or by font and color.

## definitive (?) CustomFilter
A one-stop-shop file to compare your font's character set to new and old industry standards, including standards from Apple, Micrisoft, Linotype, Monotype, Adobe, ISO and the more recent Koeberlin and SharpType.

## mark and mark2mark feature helpers
Not at all a definitive solution but a quick way to write some mark features to test mark attachments for minority writing systems on the fly.
